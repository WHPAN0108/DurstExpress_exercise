Durstexpress data science application challenge
Thank you for applying to work at Durstexpress and for taking the time to attempt this challenge!

The purpose of the challenge is to assess your technical skill in data science. Should you be invited to an onsite interview, your solutions will also be the starting point for technical discussions at that interview.

The topic of this challenge is the quantitative assessment of the effect of external factors on beer sales. The (artifical) dataset for two tasks below is in the file data.csv, which you should have also received. This dataset contains the follwoing values for each day of 2019:

* Number of crates of beers sold
* Hours of daylight
* Public holiday (0 or 1)
* Mean temperature in Â°C

Before you begin the challenge, please read the following instructions:

1. Please include your name and the date in the first cell of the notebook.
1. Please write your solutions in Python.
1. Please explain your working. This doean't have to be extensive, but enough for someone reading your notebook to be able to understand what you have done.
1. You need only consider linear models.
1. Once you have completed the two tasks below, please email your .ipynb file to your contact person at Durstexpress HR.
